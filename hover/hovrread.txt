USING HOVER! WITH MOUSEKEYS ENABLED
===================================
If you have used the Accessibility Options in Control Panel to turn
on MouseKeys, you must reassign the keys you use to maneuver your
Hovercraft. To do this, carry out the following procedure:
1. On the Options menu, click Player Controls.
2. Click Set Keys.
3. Choose the keys you want to use to move your Hovercraft.


TIPS FOR PLAYING HOVER!
=======================
Collect objects such as jumps and walls whenever you have a chance. 
They will be useful on the higher levels.

If you see a drone that has already captured one of your flags, and a
flag-remover pad is nearby, bump the drone onto the pad and the drone
will drop the flag.

If a drone is in pursuit or on the way to collecting a flag, you can
knock it into a skid pad to get it off course, confuse it, and slow
it down.

If a drone is near a hold or skid pad, drop a wall in front of it to
send it into the wall and onto the pad!

If you see a hazard coming up that you can't avoid, use a jump (if
you have one) to jump over the square.

Use walls and skid pads to rapidly change direction to avoid drones
and other hazards.


RUNNING HOVER! FASTER
=====================
Quit all other programs.

If you want to run Hover! in the fastest possible full-screen mode,
press F4. Hover! will run fast, but the graphics will be displayed
in less detail.

If you want to run Hover! in 640x480 full-screen mode, press SHIFT+F4.
Hover! will display higher resolution graphics, but will run slower.

If you are using a computer with the Energy Star power-saver feature
turned on, you will periodically experience very slow frame rates.
To enable Hover! to run faster, turn off the energy-saving feature
by carrying out the following procedure:
1. In Control Panel, double-click the Power Management icon.
2. Click the Power Management check box.


IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS WITH SOUND
===============================
If you are experiencing problems with the sound effects in Hover!,
you can run a special program to identify the exact sound card you
have by carrying out the following procedure:
1. Insert your Windows 95 CD-ROM in the CD-ROM drive and then open
   the Sounds folder, which is located in the Funstuff\Hover folder.
2. Double-click the icon for Wmconfig.exe, and then follow the
   instructions on your screen.
3. If you don't know what kind of sound card you have or can't find
   its name on the list, click the first Generic option on the list,
   and then click Test.
4. Restart Hover! and see if the sound effects are correct. If they
   are not, repeat steps 3 and 4 until the sound effects work
   properly.
